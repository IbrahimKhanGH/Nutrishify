        <h3 class="question">How Does it Work?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          Nutrishify combines the power of the Spotify API to provide users with valuable insights into their music listening habits. By leveraging the Spotify API, Nutrishify retrieves your listening history and identifies your top songs based on play counts. This information is then displayed in a visually appealing nutrition label format, allowing you to easily grasp the themes and trends prevalent in your favorite songs.

          It's important to note that Nutrishify prioritizes user privacy and data security. The application does not store any personal data or listening history, ensuring that your information remains confidential throughout the process.
        </p>

        <h3 class="question">But I don't even listen to this artist! Why are they on my list?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          Nutrishify uses data collected by Spotify about your top 50 songs in the short term (~one month), medium term (~half year), and long term (several years). If you're surprised that a certain artist or song made your list, it may be something you listened to a long time ago, or there may not be too many songs you've listened to more than them.
        </p>

        <h3 class="question">How frequently is the data updated on Nutrishify?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          The data on Nutrishify is retrieved from the Spotify API, which provides the most updated information available at the time of retrieval. While it may not be real-time in the sense of immediate updates as soon as a change occurs in your listening history, it does provide the most recent data accessible through the Spotify API. The frequency of updates to your listening history and other data on Nutrishify depends on how frequently the Spotify API updates its information. Therefore, the data you receive from Nutrishify represents the most up-to-date information provided by the Spotify API.
